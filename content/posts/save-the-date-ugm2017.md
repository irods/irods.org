We are excited to announce that the 2017 User Group Meeting will be held
June 13-15 at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.

The UGM on June 14 and 15 will feature use case presentations, live demonstrations,
and open discussions about requested iRODS features. We anticipate participants
representing academic, government, and commercial institutions worldwide.

The iRODS team will provide beginner and advanced one-day training sessions on
Tuesday, June 13. Registration will be open soon, so mark your calendars -
and start thinking about proposals for papers or demos you may wish to present.
