CHAPEL HILL, NC, May 12, 2015 – Cleversafe, the market share leader in
web-scale data storage, will become the ninth member of the iRODS
Consortium, a membership-based foundation organized to sustain the
integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) as free open source data
management software.

Cleversafe, a Chicago-based company, delivers a breakthrough private
cloud platform that solves petabyte-and-beyond storage challenges.
Relied upon by the world’s largest data repositories, Cleversafe reduces
80 percent or more of storage costs while providing carrier-grade
security, 15 nines of reliability, and simplified storage management.
Cleversafe joins a growing list of consortium members who have gathered
to collaborate on iRODS, free open source software for data discovery,
workflow automation, secure collaboration and data virtualization. The
consortium was formed by RENCI (the Renaissance Computing Institute) and
the Data Intensive Cyber Environments (DICE) Center, both research
institutes at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

“We recently released the Cleversafe Connector, an iRODS plugin that
provides high performance access to a Cleversafe object store for iRODs
data management software,” said Russ Kennedy, Cleversafe’s senior vice
president of Product Strategy and Customer Solutions. “We look forward
to participating in the iRODS Consortium, as it provides a venue for
further collaboration with the core development team and other
consortium members. iRODS is an important tool for sharing, managing,
and using the vast amounts of data we at Cleversafe enable our customers
to store. With the consortium, we look forward to helping to shape the
future of this technology.”

Thousands of businesses, research centers, and government agencies
worldwide use iRODS to manage critical data in many disciplines and
industries, such as genomic medicine (e.g., the Broad Institute and the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute); climate research (e.g., NOAA’s
National Climatic Data Center and NASA’s Center for Climate Simulation);
and seismology (e.g., the Southern California Earthquake Center). Large
libraries, such as the French National Library and the Texas Digital
Libraries, also use iRODS to control their data.

“Adding Cleversafe to our consortium roster opens up many exciting
opportunities for collaboration,” said Dan Bedard, Interim Executive
Director of the iRODS Consortium. “They bring a technology focus that
manages to be both cutting edge and reliable, and with that technology
comes a customer base that needs iRODS to take control of their data. I
can’t wait to see what we will come up with together to tackle the
challenges of managing big data.”

In addition to RENCI, DICE, and Cleversafe, the Consortium includes
DataDirect Networks (DDN), EMC Corporation, Seagate, the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute, IBM, and NASA’s Atmospheric Science Data Center. For
