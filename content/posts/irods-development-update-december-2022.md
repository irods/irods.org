Hello everyone!

It's hard to believe we're already at the end of 2022. Time sure does fly.

To start things off, we've started working on updating the roadmap for iRODS. iRODS 4.3.0 was released back in June of this year and it's time to start thinking about what the next major release should deliver. We hope to have something to show soon.

Back in October, we mentioned that we were experimenting with allowing the identity attached to a connection/agent to be changed in realtime. Well, that effort was a success and that work will be available to all clients in the form of a new API plugin called `rc_switch_user`. With that also comes a new C header file, `library_features.h`, which gives C/C++ developers a way to query the iRODS library for various features at compile-time.

Python iRODS Client 1.1.6 is very close to a release. It will include enhancements and bug fixes for SSL, Microsoft Windows, permissions, and various other things. For example, the PRC now honors SSL settings in **irods_environment.json** just like the iCommands. Users will no longer be required to pass a default generated context to enable SSL. We hope Python users find the upcoming release very helpful.

For the iRODS Development Environment, we're adding support for Red Hat Universal Base Image 8 (ubi8), updating the Docker files to use new Dockerfile syntax/features, and adding Docker images for use with QtCreator. As for the iRODS Testing Environment, we've added support for Rocky Linux 8.

Notable mentions include new releases of the C++ REST API and the Zone Management Tool.

That wraps up the final development update for this year.

Have a wonderful holiday and see you in 2023!
