Status: published

RENCI is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the new
E-iRODS distribution managed and overseen by the [E-iRODS
Consortium](http://irods.org/consortium).

This release marks a continued progress towards our first full release
which will be provided with documentation and backed by extensive unit,
functional, and regression testing running continuously on RENCI's open
infrastructure.

3.0rc1 includes all community bugfixes through iRODS 3.2 but is feature
comparable with iRODS 3.0.

In addition, this release includes PAM authentication and new resource
plugins usable with the Composable Resources included in the last beta,
3.0b3. These include a replication coordinating resource, a random
coordinating resource, a nonblocking storage resource, a universalMSS
storage resource, and a legacy compound resource. As this is release
candidate software with powerful new functionality, please use it with
care – it is not yet ready for production deployment.

This release includes packages that have been continuously tested on
CentOS 5 and 6, SuSE 11 and 12, and Ubuntu 10 and 12.
