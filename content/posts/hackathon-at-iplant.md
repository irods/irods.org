The [iPlant Collaborative](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/) held a
hackathon with the [DICE Group](http://dice.unc.edu/) and the iRODS
Consortium last week.

iPlant and the DICE group have been working together for several years
through the [DataNet Federation Consortium](http://datafed.org/), with
support from the National Science Foundation.

iPlant uses iRODS in its [Data
Store](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ci/data-store). The Data Store
provides cloud-based data storage for the iPlant Collaborative's suite
of cyberinfrastructure (CI) tools, such as
[Atmosphere](https://atmo.iplantcollaborative.org/login/) and the
[Discovery
Environment](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ci/discovery-environment),
which enable researchers to create, share, and orchestrate complex
genomics workflows across computing resources.

From the iPlant Collaborative's blog:

> The onsite, in-person hackathon led to the generation of ideas for
> future enhancements for iPlant’s CI and iRODS *[...]* as well as other
> potential future collaboration opportunities between both
> organizations.
