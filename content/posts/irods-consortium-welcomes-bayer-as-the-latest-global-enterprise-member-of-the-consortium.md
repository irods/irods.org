**CHAPEL HILL, NC – August 11, 2016 –** The iRODS Consortium welcomes
Bayer, a global life science company with core competencies in the
fields of health care and agriculture, as the latest consortium member.

Launched in 2014, the membership-based iRODS Consortium leads the
development and support of the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System
(iRODS) as free open source software for managing large, complex data.
Bayer uses iRODS to manage life sciences data at large scale.

The advent of the genomics era brought a number of new challenges in
scientific data management. Data volumes have increased dramatically,
and the high information density of personal patient data requires high
standards for data security, data privacy, and traceability of data
flows. A system was needed which is able to handle distributed data at
petabyte scale, which allows secure and fine-grained access control, and
which manages rich metadata independent of underlying platforms. The
iRODS technology addresses those needs and can manage large-scale
genomic and molecular data in research and development.

“Similar questions need to be addressed at Bayer’s Crop Science
Division”, said Thomas Schilling, Head of IT at Digital Farming. “With
the need to handle high amounts of mostly geolocated data, we need the
scalability, security, traceability and access control that the iRODS
technology offers. In addition the metadata tagging allows us to create
flexible adhoc data-marts to enable data driven research and development
to further improve our offerings.”

The iRODS Consortium membership has doubled in the last year and now
stands at 15. Other members are the Renaissance Computing Institute
(RENCI) and the Data Intensive Cyber Environments (DICE) Center at
UNC-Chapel Hill, Seagate, DataDirect Networks, Western Digital/HGST,
Panasas, IBM, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Complete Genomics,
the National Institute for Computational Sciences at the University of
Tennessee, University College London, EMC, Utrecht University, and
NASA’s Atmospheric Science Data Center.

“Bayer’s membership in the iRODS Consortium means we will be better able
to address the data challenges of life sciences enterprises,” said Jason
Coposky, Interim Executive Director of the consortium. “We look forward
to ongoing collaboration with Bayer and know they will be great
contributors to our growing open source community.”
