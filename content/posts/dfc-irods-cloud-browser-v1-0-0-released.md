It is with great enthusiasm that we announce the first version of the
[DFC iRODS Cloud
Browser](https://github.com/DICE-UNC/irods-cloud-browser). This effort
has been spearheaded by the [DataNet Federation
Consortium](http://datafed.org/)\*, with extensive collaboration and
assistance from the User Interface Team of the iRODS Consortium.

This first release requires a couple of manual steps to install and set
up the web application properly. We are in the process of developing a
smooth packaging deployment that will be part of the future releases.
You can find the deployment packages and the installation instructions
here:

This initial release will be followed up with short sprints as we
continue to add features and enhance the packaging and deployment.
Expect other announcements soon!
