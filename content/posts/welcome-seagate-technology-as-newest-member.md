CHAPEL HILL, NC, November 10, 2014 – Seagate Technology, a world leader
in storage solutions, is the latest corporation to join the iRODS
Consortium, a group that supports and guides the continued development
of the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System, or iRODS.  
<!--more-->

The iRODS Consortium was formed almost two years ago by founding members
RENCI and the Data Intensive Cyber Environment (DICE) research group,
both based at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Seagate
joins three additional Consortium members: DataDirect Networks (DDN),
the UK-based Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and EMC Corporation.

iRODS is highly configurable free open source software that provides
data discovery, management, and sharing capabilities to an extensive
user base, particularly in the life sciences and digital library
community. The iRODS Consortium staffs a full-time engineering and
support team that continues to develop iRODS, based on the software code
originally developed by the DICE group.

Seagate recently announced it has further strengthened its position as a
trusted storage solutions leader by delivering cloud systems and
solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and
“do-it-yourself (DIY)” organizations. Seagate is building on its
position as a steward of digital information, and its acquisitions of
Xyratex and EVault, to deliver Intelligent Information Infrastructure
systems that help partners and their customers manage the massive growth
in digital data and deliver on next generation workloads.

Engineered for high-performance computing, Seagate’s ClusterStor
solutions combine ultra dense data enclosures, operating system,
hardware controllers, and the Lustre^®^ file system in a consolidated,
scale-out platform. The award-winning Seagate ClusterStor solution
removes the complexities associated with deploying and maintaining
traditional high-performance systems yielding faster time to results,
ease of use and management, and world-class performance to meet
mission-critical needs.

“Our customers require the ability to process ever-growing digital data
sets for simulations, modeling, and real-time analytics with the highest
performance possible,” said Ken Claffey, Vice President of ClusterStor,
Seagate Cloud Systems and Solutions. “As these data sets grow to
multiple petabytes in size tools for data management and collaboration
are increasingly essential. We see iRODS as an important technology for
data management and we look forward to taking an active role in the
success of iRODS and the iRODS Consortium.”

“Both Seagate and the iRODS Consortium understand how important it is to
address the data management needs of research and business organizations
who are facing an explosion of digital data,” said iRODS Consortium
Executive Director Brand Fortner. “Seagate’s insights and expertise will
make this consortium stronger. We enthusiastically welcome them to the
iRODS community.”

**iRODS@SC14**

Attendees of the SC14 conference in New Orleans will have the
opportunity to learn more about iRODS and the iRODS Consortium in the
RENCI booth (\#533). iRODS developers will present demonstrations and
tutorials of the newest version of the software (iRODS 4.0.3) and its
plugins throughout the week.

Conference participants are also invited to attend an iRODS reception on
Wednesday, Nov. 19, at the Westin New Orleans Canal Place, 100 Iberville
St. beginning at 5 p.m. The reception, sponsored by consortium member
DDN, will offer the chance to interact informally with iRODS users and
consortium members, and to hear about iRODS use cases and success
stories. Light food will be served and a cash bar will be available.
