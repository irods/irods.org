Two announcements today about the upcoming [iRODS User Group Meeting 2019 in Utrecht, Netherlands](https://irods.org/ugm2019/):

First, the iRODS Consortium is happy to announce the iRODS UGM Best Student Paper Award.  The DICE team (including Reagan Moore, Arcot Rajasekar, and Hao Xu) has worked with the iRODS Consortium to fund this $200 award into the future and to encourage submissions of ongoing iRODS-related work from students around the world.  To be eligible, the student (from undergraduate to doctoral) must be a named author and is expected to present at the User Group Meeting.

And second, the [Call for Talks/Papers](https://irods.org/ugm2019/cfp/) is being extended until May 1, 2019.  We expect another full lineup this year, and we would love to hear about what you're developing, what you've deployed, what you've learned, or even what you'd like iRODS to do in the future.  We're also very interested in comparative studies with other software in the market - help us explain why iRODS was selected to power your data management infrastructure.  [Have a look through the past few years](https://irods.org/ugm/) to see the level of talks we have come to expect.
