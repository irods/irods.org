Status: published

RENCI is pleased to announce the second beta of the fourth major open
source release of iRODS, managed and overseen by the [iRODS
Consortium](http://irods-consortium.org/).

iRODS 4.0.0 will mark a reunification and merger of the community
codebase of iRODS and the Enterprise codebase of E-iRODS which diverged
at iRODS 3.0 (released September 30, 2011).

All the code and current working issues are hosted at GitHub:
<https://github.com/irods/irods>

This release is another significant step towards a full plugin
architecture while remaining API compatible with existing iRODS 3.x
releases.  We are committed to keeping Federation with iRODS 3.x grids a
first class use case.

4.0.0b2 includes all community bugfixes through iRODS 3.3 as well as the
newest rule engine. This beta represents a full merger of the code
through [community iRODS r5575 (October 20,
2013)](https://github.com/irods/irods-legacy/commit/69f778e48e64f).

At this time, upgrading from either community 3.x or E-iRODS 3.0.1 will
require a manual set of steps by the grid/system administrator. Refining
this process is a central part of getting to our final release of 4.0.0
in March. If you have a production system and would like to be a part of
the testing before 4.0.0 is released, please contact us through the
