We are pleased to announce the University of Arizona has offered to host the 12th Annual iRODS User Group Meeting in Tucson, Arizona.

The four day event will be held June 9-12, 2020.

Tuesday will be a day of training for users of all levels.

Wednesday and Thursday will see presentations from the iRODS Consortium and the Community.  These talks consist of use cases, live demonstrations, and open discussions around upcoming features and requests.

Friday will be a day of interoperability testing, bug fixing, and tool building during the Hackathon.  The entire iRODS development team will be on-hand to help get your project over the next hurdle.

We anticipate conference participation from all over the world representing academic, government, and commercial institutions.
