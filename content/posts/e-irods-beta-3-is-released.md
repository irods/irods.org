RENCI is pleased to announce the third beta release of the new E-iRODS
distribution on the Ides of March.

This release marks a continued progress towards our first full release
which will be provided with documentation and backed by extensive unit,
functional, and regression testing running continuously on RENCI's open
infrastructure.

3.0b3 includes all community bugfixes through iRODS 3.2 but is feature
comparable with iRODS 3.0.

[This release includes Composable
Resources]({filename}/uploads/2013/02/eirods-composable-resources.pdf),
the extensive work done to refactor how storage resources are handled by
the iRODS engine. As this is beta software with powerful new
functionality, please use it with care - it is not yet ready for
production deployment.

This release includes packages that have been tested on CentOS 5 and 6,
SuSE 11 and 12, and Ubuntu 10 and 12.
