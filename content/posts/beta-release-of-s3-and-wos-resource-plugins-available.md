In the run up to our full iRODS 4.0.0 release, we are finalizing a lot
of the work to package and ship a few of our plugins.

The two plugins ready today for public testing are the Amazon S3 and DDN
WOS resource plugins.

Tested packages for Ubuntu 10 and 12, SuSE 11 and 12, and CentOS 5 and 6
can be found at <ftp://ftp.renci.org/pub/irods/plugins/>

We plan to release v1.0 of these plugins alongside the final release of
iRODS 4.0.0 in March.

**S3**

**WOS**

Please confirm the checksums for the package(s) you download before
installing.

As always, please contact <info@irods.org> if you have any questions.
