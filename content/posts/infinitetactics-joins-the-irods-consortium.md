The iRODS Consortium, the membership-based foundation that leads development and support of the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System ([iRODS](https://irods.org)), welcomes its newest member, [InfiniteTactics](https://infinitetactics.com/www/).

InfiniteTactics is a veteran-owned IT consulting firm that produces high-end technical solutions in large-scale data sciences support, autonomous system engineering and technical guidance, and custom software solutions. The company supports a diverse range of clients from small business start-ups to the Department of Defense.

The iRODS Consortium is a membership-based organization that guides development and support of iRODS as free open-source software for data discovery, workflow automation, secure collaboration, and data virtualization.

The capability to efficiently manage, use, parse, store, and access data is crucial to InfiniteTactics' business model, but this becomes more challenging as customers require access to increasingly large stores of data on a daily basis. InfiniteTactics AI Software Engineer Kyle Healy said iRODS offers an opportunity for the company to overcome key file system limitations and maintain excellent performance at competitive prices to support clients' expanding data demands.

"Data management is an extremely important part of our business and the work we do because data is the integral backbone of data sciences support we provide," said Healy. "We hope iRODS will help us implement a more efficient underlying file system we can utilize to bring a better product to our customers and provide a more efficient file system for the large-scale data sciences open-source community."

The iRODS Consortium provides a production-ready distribution and professional integration services, training, and support. The consortium is administered by founding member [RENCI](https://renci.org), a research institute for applications of cyberinfrastructure located at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu), USA.

"We are very excited to bring InfiniteTactics into the fold," said Terrell Russell, executive director of the iRODS Consortium. "They are integrating a number of interesting new technologies and their belief in the open-source philosophy made for a quick partnership."

"The RENCI team is well known for their large scale storage solutions," said Healy. "Aligning ourselves with a strong partner in the storage solution industry was a great strategic move for us. Secondly, being able to provide our expertise back to the Consortium and improve the overall footprint of the large-scale data sciences open-source community through the Consortium made the decision easy."

In addition to InfiniteTactics, current iRODS Consortium members include Agriculture Victoria, Bayer, Bibiothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, CINES, CUBI at Berlin Institute of Health, DataDirect Networks, Emagine IT, KU Leuven, Maastricht University, Minnesota Supercomputing Institute at the University of Minnesota, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NetApp, Omnibond, OpenIO, RENCI, SoftIron, the SURF cooperative, Texas Advanced Computing Center, University College London, University of Colorado, Boulder, University of Groningen, Utrecht University, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Western Digital, and four organizations that wish to remain anonymous.
