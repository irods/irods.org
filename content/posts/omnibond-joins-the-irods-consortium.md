<i>Collaboration enhances synergies for improving end to end data integration</i>

The software company [Omnibond](https://obz.io) has joined the iRODS Consortium, the membership-based foundation that leads development and support of the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System ([iRODS](https://irods.org)).

Omnibond is a software technology company with four main product areas including CloudyCluster for cloud high-performance computing and data analytics, OrangeFS for research data solutions, NetIQ for identity and access management, and TrafficVision for computer vision and AI solutions for the transportation industry. Company leaders say that enhanced integration with iRODS will help provide better instrument-to-cloud data and computation management, in particular for CloudyCluster and OrangeFS software.

"We help our customers deal with large amounts of data, and collaborating with iRODS for these products will help our customers with better end to end data management," said Omnibond President and CEO Boyd Wilson. "We are excited to work with the iRODS team going forward and we are impressed with their vision and capabilities."

The iRODS Consortium is a membership-based organization that guides development and support of iRODS as free open-source software for data discovery, workflow automation, secure collaboration, and data virtualization. The iRODS Consortium provides a production-ready distribution and professional integration services, training, and support. The consortium is administered by founding member [RENCI](https://renci.org), a research institute for applications of cyberinfrastructure located at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu), USA.

"Omnibond can provide deployment and support services where we cannot, and their integration expertise extends the Consortium's reach into new markets," said Terrell Russell, executive director of the iRODS Consortium. "After working alongside one another for years, we are very happy to welcome Omnibond to the iRODS Consortium."

Wilson noted that the open-source model makes iRODS a particularly good fit for Omnibond's portfolio, which is focused around building synergies between research and open-source technologies. "We currently are the maintainers of OrangeFS, an open-source parallel file system that has been incorporated into the Linux kernel by the Linux kernel team, so we understand the value of open-source software and are excited to partner with the iRODS Consortium," said Wilson.

In addition to Omnibond, current iRODS Consortium members include Agriculture Victoria, Bayer, Bibiothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, CINES, CUBI at Berlin Institute of Health, DataDirect Networks, Emagine IT, KU Leuven, Maastricht University, Minnesota Supercomputing Institute at the University of Minnesota, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NetApp, OpenIO, RENCI, SoftIron, the SURF cooperative, Texas Advanced Computing Center, University College London, University of Colorado, Boulder, University of Groningen, Utrecht University, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Western Digital, and four organizations that wish to remain anonymous.
