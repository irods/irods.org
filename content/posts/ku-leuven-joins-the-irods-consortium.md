The [iRODS Consortium](https://irods.org), the foundation that leads development and support of the 
integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) data management software, welcomes 
KU Leuven as its newest Consortium member.

As one of Europe's oldest universities, Belgium's [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) boasts a long 
tradition of ground-breaking research and high quality education. With a new 
Research Data Management program, the university aims to accelerate science and 
innovation by enabling scientists to more effectively and efficiently find, 
access, share, and reuse data.

iRODS is free open source software for data virtualization, data discovery, 
workflow automation, and secure collaboration used by research and business 
organizations around the globe. iRODS allows users to catalog all of their data 
and metadata into a unified namespace, and then automate their data management 
through an integrated rules engine.

"With a strong history of supporting the management and reuse of scientific 
data at universities in Europe and around the world, iRODS is well positioned 
to provide a framework for KU Leuven's ambitious research data management 
initiative," said Jason Coposky, Executive Director, iRODS Consortium. "We 
are pleased to welcome KU Leuven to the iRODS Consortium and look forward to 
working with them to guide the development of future capabilities that will 
benefit their researchers and the broader user community."

KU Leuven plans to use iRODS in the implementation of two research data 
management (RDM) projects. One will focus on the KU Leuven research community 
while the other, integrated on the Flemish Supercomputing Center (VSC) High 
Performance Computing services, will be used by researchers of all Flemish 
universities, research institutes and industry. The RDM platform will be 
designed to accommodate easy and efficient automation of processes like data 
collection, data quality control, and policy compliance while supporting 
scalability, interoperability, and security across research groups and 
institutions.

"We believe that the distributed and modular architecture of iRODS can 
provide the grounds for a scalable RDM solution," said Annemie Depuydt, 
director of KU Leuven's IT services division. "It also offers a very 
flexible environment to make it easy to ensure our platform can interoperate 
with other data repositories and data platforms in a multi-institutional and 
international environment."

iRODS' open source model allows KU Leuven to take advantage of existing 
features and capabilities while also having the flexibility to tailor the 
solution to the university's specific needs. As a Consortium member, the 
university will receive consulting and training from iRODS experts as the RDM 
program takes shape.

"One of the main aspects that made iRODS attractive to us was its large user 
community," said Depuydt. "The possibility to share experience and 
knowledge with other institutions developing similar solutions is for us a key 
added value of iRODS. We see in the collaboration with the members of the 
Consortium an opportunity to play a leading role on the RDM landscape."

The iRODS Consortium guides development and support of iRODS, along with 
providing production-ready iRODS distribution and iRODS professional 
integration services, training, and support. The consortium is administered by 
founding member [RENCI](https://renci.org), a research institute for applications of 
cyberinfrastructure located at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://unc.edu).

In addition to KU Leuven, current members of the iRODS Consortium include 
Agriculture Victoria, Bayer, Cloudian, University of Colorado, Boulder, 
DataDirect Networks, Maastricht University, MSC, the U.S. National Institute of 
Environmental Health Sciences, NetApp, OpenIO, Quantum, RENCI, SURF, the 
Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing, SUSE, Texas Advanced Computing 
Center (TACC), University College London, University of Groningen, Utrecht 
University, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Western Digital, and two additional 
anonymous members.
