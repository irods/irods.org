[Cloudian](https://cloudian.com) has joined the iRODS Consortium, the foundation that leads development and support of the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS). Testing for HyperStore enterprise object storage with iRODS is complete, and users may now deploy the combined solution where local workflows require cost-effective, exabyte-scalable storage and ease of integration. 

iRODS is free open source software for data discovery, workflow automation, secure collaboration, and data virtualization used by research and business organizations around the globe. Easily deployed in an existing infrastructure, iRODS creates a unified namespace and a metadata catalog of all the data and users within the storage environment. With the iRODS rule engine framework, users can completely automate an organization's data management policy.

"We're thrilled to be working with Cloudian, a leader in enterprise object storage," said Jason Coposky, executive director, iRODS Consortium. "Their unique perspective on customer requirements in a super-capacity storage environment will add an important dimension as we build out the next generation of policy-based data management software."

Cloudian HyperStore solves the capacity storage challenge for global businesses in data-intensive verticals such as media, healthcare, and manufacturing. Cloudian's global storage fabric, geo-distribution capability, and seamless cloud integration provide simple, efficient data management across the storage landscape. Unlike traditional storage solutions whose architectures were derived from stand-alone systems that operate within a single data center, Cloudian's architecture was built on cloud technologies that were designed for distributed environments and limitless scale. 

Cloudian joins Bayer, Dell EMC, Data Direct Networks, IBM, Intel, MSC, the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NetApp, Quantum, RENCI, SURF, the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing, Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), University College London, University of Groningen, Utrecht University, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and Western Digital as iRODS Consortium members.

"Increasing data management efficiency is central to our customers' objectives as they strive to manage more complex storage environments without increasing management workload," said Sanjay Jagad, senior director of products and solutions at Cloudian. "By validating Cloudian HyperStore in the iRODS environment, we provide our users with another opportunity to deliver greater value from their storage environment at less cost."
