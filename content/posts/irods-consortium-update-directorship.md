Today we announce that Brand Fortner, formerly the Executive Director of
the iRODS Consortium, is departing RENCI. We wish Brand the very best in
his new endeavors.

As of April 1st, 2015, Dan Bedard has been appointed to serve as the
Interim Director of the iRODS Consortium. Dan has led the Consortium's
sales, marketing, and contract services efforts for the the past 11
months. In this new role, Dan has the full support of RENCI (the
organization that administers the Consortium), Chief Technologist Jason
Coposky, DICE Director Dr. Reagan Moore, and the Consortium's advisory
board.

Since the transition, Dan has been reaching out to Consortium members,
clients, and advisors to answer questions and to ask for their feedback
and ideas. We also welcome feedback from all members of the iRODS
community. Please feel free to contact Dan directly at danb (at)
renci.org at any time, or use our [contact
page](http://irods.org/contact/ "Contact Us…") to connect.

Without question, RENCI remains committed to the success of the iRODS
Consortium. We all are eagerly awaiting the release of iRODS 4.1 in a
few weeks, and we look forward to talking with you at the User Group
Meeting here in Chapel Hill in June.
