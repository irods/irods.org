Status: published


Wooh! April has been a busy, yet exciting month. 4.3.0 is looking really good. We have a few more issues to take care of before it's ready. 

Let's get into this month's development update.

The 4.3.0 server implementation has received some important changes. We've changed the name of the delay server binary from `irodsReServer` to `irodsDelayServer`. This change covers more than a renaming of the binary; It includes tests, variables, configuration properties, etc. The upgrade logic will now synchronize your server_config.json file with the template. On upgrade, all configuration properties will be defined in server_config.json. Aside from the delay server and upgrade logic, we've demonstrated the ability to migrate the delay server between iRODS servers. 

`irods-grid` will no longer be provided via the icommands. Given its design, we've decided to include it with the server. This change is important because `irods-grid` is special, in that it does not authenticate or carry out operations like the other icommands.

The iRODS Testing Environment has continued to receive steady improvements as well as expose issues previous testing systems were not able to. We've consolidated the main and 4-2-stable branches and because of the implementation, we can now parallelize many if not all plugin tests. Not only have we provided enhancements, we've also fixed several bugs including but not limited to, a Python/SSH namespace collision that prevented driver downloads. iRODS 4.3.0 will be the first official release based on the iRODS Testing Environment.

The S3 Resource Plugin has seen some recent updates as well. In regards to iRODS 4.3.0, it now uses the new Logging API. With this comes the ability to adjust the log output in real-time and identify which messages were produced by the plugin. A new version of the plugin was released as well. Aside from performance and stability improvements, the most notable change provided by S3 Resource Plugin 4.2.11.2 is the fix for large file uploads. If you're experiencing issues around large file uploads, give this new version a try.

The Indexing Capability Plugin has been under heavy development. Indexing is now triggered by `iput --metadata`. Handling of configuration values has received a nice quality of life change. That is, integers can be used for properties that only took integers as strings. Lastly, the plugin has grown the ability to index user permissions based on the NIEHS AVU/system-metadata schema. We hope users of this plugin find these changes helpful.

Python iRODS Client (PRC) 1.1.3 was released this month. And since we're on the topic of Python now, you'll be happy to know that the Python Rule Engine Plugin (PREP) can now be built using the development environment. It is also supported by the testing environment.

We hope you found this month's update exciting. As always, see you next month!
