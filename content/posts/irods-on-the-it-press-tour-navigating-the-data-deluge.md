<i>iRODS Executive Director Terrell Russell spoke to the press about next steps for the data management software</i>

iRODS Executive Director Terrell Russell participated in the [58th Edition of the IT Press Tour](https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2024/09/24/58th-edition-of-it-press-tour-in-boston-ma/) in Boston, MA in early October. This edition was dedicated to innovations in IT infrastructure, cloud, networking, security, data and storage management, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), across all these topics.

The Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) is open source data management software used by research, commercial, and governmental organizations worldwide. The software is versatile, and is used by supercomputing centers and organizations working with data from fields such as physics, life sciences, genomics, health, financial services, and more.

During the event, Russell spoke to the press about the necessity of data management software as we move towards the “zettabyte era.” He discussed the software’s key strengths and features, including data virtualization, policy-based automation, secure collaboration, and data discovery through a metadata-centric approach. 

Russell shared future plans to form partnerships with system integrators who are interested in building iRODS into new vertical solutions for their customers. iRODS integrations provide a layer of seamless data management, without the need to replace existing storage systems. 

"The larger the organization, the more they need software like iRODS," said Russell. "iRODS provides flexible insurance against the future. You know you will change your policy if you've been around long enough. You will buy a new shiny thing and plug it in. You will have to move stuff around, but this way, maybe your users, clients, and students don't need to learn new tricks."
