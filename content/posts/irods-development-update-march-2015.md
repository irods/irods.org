Status: published

We skipped having a Technology Working Group meeting in March, so in
this post we'll focus on some development highlights from this month, as
well as review a new feature added for the upcoming 4.1 release: the
control plane.

### Development Highlights

-   Coverity Clean - Thanks to Zoey, the iRODS core code is
    nearly clean. Starting from over 1100 identified defects, we have
    only 92 defects remaining: We still have some errors in our external
    libraries, over 60 of which are in Boost. Those will either be
    accepted by that project for the next release, or we will roll the
    fixes into our own builds for 4.1. The rest of the defects will be
    cleaned up as we move to a more modern compiler.  Using
    [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/2605) alone has vastly
    improved iRODS stability, and coupled with the other tools
    deployed within our CI infrastructure, brings iRODS to a much more
    production-ready state.
-   Continuous Topology Testing - Thanks to Ben, our JSON-based Zone
    descriptions are now ingested by an
    [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/ "Ansible")-driven engine, which
    will deploy a full iRODS topology in our cloud infrastructure.  The
    current deployment is 1 iCAT server + 3 resource servers, and it
    runs our full feature testing suite from both the iCAT and a given
    resource server on every commit to our GitHub repository.  The
    current state of topology testing can be found
    [here](https://jenkins.irods.org/view/1.%20Core%20Development/ "here"),
    and the full CI system can be viewed
    [here](https://jenkins.irods.org/ "here").
-   Documentation - Through Terrell's efforts, we are working toward
    having iRODS documentation fully contained within the code
    repository. This way, as we continue to advance how iRODS works, the
    documents will remain in lockstep with the code.  We are using
    [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/ "Doxygen") for microservice and
    API documentation and [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/ "MkDocs") for
    all other documentation (admin, user, developer, etc.).
-   Python - Thanks to Antoine, the [python client
    library](https://github.com/irods/python-irodsclient) now supports
    administrative operations for user and resource management. General
    query is now based on a python generator, which improves efficiency
    when processing a large number of results. These new features are in
    CI and tested on Python 2.6 and 2.7 with over 70% coverage.
-   New Platforms - Because why not, we have successfully compiled iRODS
    out of the box on a [Raspberry Pi
    2](http://www.adafruit.com/products/2358 "Raspberry Pi 2"). This
    opens up interesting new use cases for portable iRODS appliances.
    iRODS has now also been ported to the IBM POWER8 LE and is passing
    topology testing. More detail on this development in a separate
    post.

### The Control Plane

A fundamental concept within iRODS is virtualization, the separation of
the logical from the physical.  This separation is provided by iRODS
along several different axes: storage, networking, authentication, and
other plugins as well as the iRODS logical namespace itself. To
further refine terminology around this concept, we have separated the
use of the terms Zone and Grid into two distinct entities. We now use
the term Zone to refer to the purely logical portion of an iRODS
deployment and the term Grid to describe the purely physical. An iRODS
Zone provides services to clients via the iRODS API and the wire-line
protocol.

Previously, an iRODS Grid had no means of communicating with the outside
world.  There was no mechanism to gracefully shut down a grid,
preventing new connections while allowing existing connections to
complete their transactions. There was no means to pause the grid to
install new plugins, and no way to resume afterward.  And there was no
way to query the health of the grid itself.

To fill in these gaps, we have created a new communication channel to
allow data grid administrators to control an iRODS Grid from the command
line. We have created a new command line tool, *irods-grid*, which will
communicate directly with a new thread within the irodsServer, which
will service these new requirements.

#### The *irods-grid* Command

The control plane is the first addition to iRODS which leverages
[ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/ "ZeroMQ") and
[Avro](https://avro.apache.org/ "Avro"), new technologies that will
continue to be integrated as standard interfaces within iRODS going
forward.  The *irods-grid* command is a standalone client to the control
plane, but much like the iRODS API itself, the control plane may be
reached by any other system which interfaces with ZeroMQ at the network
layer and uses Avro for serialization.

There are currently four different actions, or subcommands, that the
control plane supports, which may target either one or more hosts or the
entire grid. These actions will timeout after a given number of seconds,
or block forever.

The *irods-grid* command takes the following parameters:

    irods@host:~$ irods-grid --help
    usage: 'irods-grid action [ option ] target'
    action: ( required ) status, pause, resume, shutdown
    option: --force-after=seconds or --wait-forever
    target: ( required ) --all, --hosts=", , ..."

For example, if an administrator wanted to query the status of a single
server, the command would look like:

    irods-grid status --host=host.example.org

and the output would look like:

    {
      "hosts": [
        {
          "hostname": "host.example.org",
          "irods_server_pid": 15399,
          "agents": [
             {
               "agent_pid": 22192,
               "age": 0
             }
          ],
          "xmsg_server_pid": 0,
          "status": "server_state_running",
          "re_server_pid": 15401
        }
      ]
    }

If an administrator wanted to pause the entire grid, do some updates,
and then resume it later the commands would be:

    irods-grid pause --all

and then:

    irods-grid resume --all

The control plane will then reach out to the iCAT server and request all
the unique host names for every resource server in order to create the
list of hosts to reach for forwarding the command.  Should a smaller
list of hosts be required, the fully qualified domain names can be
listed as follows:

    irods-grid pause --hosts="host1.example.org, host2.example.org"

If a server is particularly stuck, the administrator can use the
--force-after switch to force the operation after a given grace period.
 Or if a particularly important job is in flight, the command can block
forever using the --wait-forever switch.

#### Configuration and Security

The *irods-grid* command is purely within the control of a data-grid
administrator. For this reason we decided to secure this side-channel
communication with symmetric grid-wide keys. This way the only way a
grid may be paused, shutdown or queried is by an administrator with the
proper credentials. For the client side, the \`irods\_environment.json\`
holds the port, key, and information about the encryption methodology:

    "irods_server_control_plane_port": 1248,
    "irods_server_control_plane_key": "TEMPORARY__32byte_ctrl_plane_key",
    "irods_server_control_plane_encryption_num_hash_rounds": 16,
    "irods_server_control_plane_encryption_algorithm": "AES-256-CBC"

And for the server side of the configuration (\`server\_config.json\`),
which needs to match the clients as well as all of the servers, we have
a very similar configuration:

    "server_control_plane_port": 1248,
    "server_control_plane_key": "TEMPORARY__32byte_ctrl_plane_key",
    "server_control_plane_encryption_num_hash_rounds": 16,
    "server_control_plane_encryption_algorithm": "AES-256-CBC",
    "server_control_plane_timeout_milliseconds": 10000

As the control plane works grid-wide, the server handling the request
from *irods-grid* will forward a command when requested. This is the
motivation for the addition of the timeout; If a server doesn't respond
within an appropriate time frame, it is assumed to be down. This is an
important point of tuning if a grid has very remote servers.

### Happy Birthday, iRODS 4

One more note: we released iRODS 4.0 on March 28, 2014. iRODS 4.0 is
officially one year old. As we plan to release iRODS 4.1 in just a few
weeks, I'm reminded that none of this would be possible without the user
community, the original iRODS team, and my Consortium colleagues. Thank
you all for your dedication, your hard work, your criticisms, and your
ideas. And Happy Birthday to iRODS 4!
