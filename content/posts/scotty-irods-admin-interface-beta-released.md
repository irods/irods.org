RENCI is attending the [2013 iRODS User Group Meeting in Garching,
Germany](https://www.irods.org/index.php/iRODS_User_Group_Meeting_2013)
this week.

The meeting is being hosted by the [Max Planck Institute of Plasma
Physics (IPP)](http://www.ipp.mpg.de/ippcms/eng/index.html).

Our second presentation at the meeting is about the beta release of
Scotty, the iRODS Administration Interface.

> Scotty is a web-based iRODS Administration dashboard that can connect
> to any running iRODS Zone (grid). Connections are limited to iRODS
> users with the “rodsadmin” designation.
>
> Scotty is a java application that runs on Tomcat and uses the Jargon
> API to communicate with iRODS. The iRODS server can be either local or
> remote. Scotty provides cumulative statistics for users, resources,
> and files in a single Zone as well as user and password management.
>
> Since Scotty can be installed and run separately from the iRODS server
> (from any capable networked computer) and provides a dashboard for any
> iRODS Zone, it stores no connection information and no metric
> information locally.<!--more-->
