**Note:** [Cloud
Browser](http://irods.org/2015/12/dfc-irods-cloud-browser-v1-0-0-released/)
has superseded all iDrop Web development. Please see [this blog
post](http://irods.org/2015/12/dfc-irods-cloud-browser-v1-0-0-released/)
or [Github](https://github.com/DICE-UNC/irods-cloud-browser) for
additional information.

So, you've [set up an iCAT
server](http://irods.org/post/icat-on-a-vm/ "iRODS Demos: iCAT on a VM"),
but your users need a graphical interface to upload and download files
and examine metadata. And for a variety of reasons, you don't have the
option of installing a client on each user's machine. So how can you
make it so your users can access iRODS?

**Note:** *December 4, 2014: I've updated this post with paths to stable
locations for the iDrop Web 2 files.*

You may have heard that [there are web-based iRODS
clients](http://irods.org/post/irods-user-interfaces/ "iRODS User Interfaces").
Actually, there are several ways to access iRODS through the web, using
interfaces developed and maintained by the [DICE
Center](http://dice.unc.edu/ "DICE Center") at UNC. One such
interface--and one of the easiest to deploy--is iDrop Web 2, which is a
Java-based iRODS client hosted on a Java application web server. In this
post, I will walk through setting up iDrop Web 2 on a VM that also hosts
an iCAT server. Note that iDrop Web 2 and iRODS can be hosted on
separate machines; we use a single server in this demo for the sake of
simplicity. If you follow these instructions, you will have a
functioning iRODS installation that you can access through a web
browser. I'm sure you're eager to get started, so here we go!

Note: This is a quick installation for demonstration purposes. There are
myriad customizations that you can make, and you should investigate and
plan thoroughly before going to production with your setup.

#### iDrop Web 2 and iRODS on a VM

Step 1. First, you'll want to [set up an iCAT
server](http://irods.org/post/icat-on-a-vm/ "iRODS Demos: iCAT on a VM"),
as explained in my previous post.

Step 2. Next, you need to install a Java web application server to host
iDrop Web. I use Tomcat for this.

~~~~
iCAT-VM$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk tomcat6
~~~~

Step 3. Download and edit the iDrop Web 2 configuration file.

~~~~
iCAT-VM$ sudo mkdir /etc/idrop-web
iCAT-VM$ sudo wget -P /etc/idrop-web http://people.renci.org/~danb/FOR_DEMOS/iDrop-Web-2/idrop-web-config2.groovy
~~~~

Edit /etc/idrop-web-config2.groovy.

Uncomment section 2 to have iDrop Web 2 automatically point to the iRODS
server on localhost, and update the zone name and resource name to match
your iRODS configuration. Note that I have added a slash on line 21 to
close the previous comment and removed a "\*/" on line 28, where the
comment used to terminate.

environments {

     production {  grails.serverURL = "http://localhost:8080/idrop-web2" }

}

/*
 * 2) If you want to set things up so that the idrop web browser automatically points to a certain grid (i.e. only user ID and password show, then do something like below.
 * Take the following outside of the comment block and configure here
 */
 idrop.config.preset.host="localhost"
 idrop.config.preset.port="1247"
 idrop.config.preset.zone="tempZone"
 idrop.config.preset.resource="demoResc"
 // can be Standard or PAM right now
 idrop.config.preset.authScheme="Standard"



//idrop.config.idrop.jnlp="http://iren-web.renci.org:8080/idrop/idrop.jnlp"
//drop.config.idrop.jnlp="http://iren-web.renci.org/idrop-snapshot/idrop.jnlp"
idrop.config.idrop.jnlp="http://iren-web.renci.org/idrop-snapshot/idrop.jnlp"
/*
 * 3) Customization properties
 */

// do I support tickets? This determies whether the ticket feature is available via the interface, it also requires ticket support in iRODS itself (version 3.1+)
idrop.config.use.tickets=true

// do I want to display the profile tab and maintain user profile info
idrop.config.use.userprofile=true

// do I support sharing? Requires target server to have specific query support and sharing queries loaded from jargon-user-tagging
idrop.config.use.sharing=true

// do I want to show the gallery view?
idrop.config.use.gallery.view=false

// do I want to show the browse view?
idrop.config.use.browse.view=false
~~~~

Step 4. Download the iDrop Web 2 WAR file. This is the entire iDrop Web
2 package, which Tomcat will expand automatically after it downloads.

~~~~
iCAT-VM$ sudo wget -P /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps http://people.renci.org/~danb/FOR_DEMOS/iDrop-Web-2/idrop-web2.war
~~~~

Let's see if it works. Open a browser on the VM, and point it to
http://localhost:8080/idrop-web2.

<div class="full_image"><img src="{static}/uploads/2014/08/idrop-login-300x215.png" /></div>
<div class="green_font">This is what it should look like.</div>
  

As a test case, you can log in as the iRODS administrator (the default
username is "rods"). You'll probably want to add additional users using
the iCommand <span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline">iadmin
mkuser</span>.

That's it! Now you have an iDrop Web 2 server. There are numerous ways
you may want to reconfigure it. For example:

-   Enabling access from outside the VM: You'll need to set up your VM's
    network interface to access port 8080 on the machine. You may also
    need to open port 8080 on the firewall on the VM (e.g., using
    iptables). And you will need to update section 1 of
    /etc/idrop-web/idrop-web-config2.groovy to point to the hostname or
    IP address of the VM, rather than localhost.
-   Enabling SSL to encrypt the connection between the web browser and
    iDrop Web: You will need to install certificates and update the
    Tomcat configuration. And you will need to update section 1 of
    /etc/idrop-web/idrop-web-config2.groovy to use https instead of
    http.

Happy iRODS surfing!
