To all who have submitted your abstracts for presentations at the [iRODS
User Group Meeting 2015](http://ugm2015.irods.org), thank you. We are
very impressed with the submissions so far.

Upon popular request and further evaluation of our schedule, we are
extending the deadline for [abstract
submissions](http://irods.org/ugm2015/abstract-submission/) until
**April 3rd**.

From informal conversations I have had with likely presenters, we are
expecting an agenda full of fascinating research topics, use case
overviews, and iRODS-based product announcements. We look forward to
seeing you here in Chapel Hill, June 9-11.

Please visit <http://irods.org/ugm2015/abstract-submission/> for
submission instructions.
