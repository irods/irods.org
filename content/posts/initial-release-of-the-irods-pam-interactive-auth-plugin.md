The iRODS Consortium is pleased to announce the first release of the [PAM Interactive Authentication Plugin](https://github.com/irods/irods_auth_plugin_pam_interactive).

It is released today as v0.1.0.

The plugin enables organizations to develop dynamic authentication flows that meet their needs. Using the plugin, we've demonstrated working authentication flows for OpenID Connect and Kerberos. Configuration for various authentication flows is documented in the README.

The initial implementation was developed by [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/en) and completed by the iRODS Consortium.
