Dave was a walking Rolodex of players in the HPC and data storage industry.  He knew and was known by everyone.
He approached his tasks classically: with handshakes and substantive conversation, by developing relationships
over time, and knowing names, faces, and each one's business need.

During his last few years at DDN, and the seven years since his retirement, he worked with the iRODS Consortium
to help spread the word about open source data management.  He generously shared his many long-time friends
around the globe and opened numerous opportunities, including on recent trips to Japan and Germany in May.
He was on top of the world visiting his American Airlines lounges and Hilton lobbies and will be missed tremendously.

Time is our most precious resource, and we are grateful he gave so much of his to us.
