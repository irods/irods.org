The iRODS Consortium is pleased to announce the first release of [irods4j](https://github.com/irods/irods4j), a new Java client library for iRODS.

It is released today as v0.1.0 and targets Java 17 and iRODS 4.3.2.

The library is designed to put the full power of the iRODS API into the hands of Java developers by exposing APIs matching those found in the C and C++ libraries.

This release includes support for SSL/TLS, native and pam_password authentication schemes, and several high-level APIs for common iRODS tasks.

The library is published at [Maven Central Repository](https://central.sonatype.com/).
