Title: iRODS Development Update: June 2022
Date: 2022-06-28 17:00
Author: Kory Draughn
Slug: irods-development-update-june-2022
Status: published


First off, for people who may have missed it, [iRODS 4.3.0 is available now](https://irods.org/2022/06/irods-4-3-0-is-released/)!

Our annual User Group Meeting (UGM) is only one week away as well! You can read more about that [here](https://irods.org/ugm2022/).

One more thing before we get into the development update ... Five new interns have joined us for the summer! We'll talk more about what they're working on at UGM.

With that said, let's talk about what's happened since last month.

Support for Almalinux 8, Debian 11, and Ubuntu 20.04 has been improved in the Development Environment and Testing Environment.

Debugging tools and runner images have been added to the Development Environment. The Testing Environment can now launch containers on remote computers via the Docker daemon. Not only that, but MySQL 8 can now be used for testing.

Since we're on the topic of MySQL, users who prefer MySQL as their database will be happy to know that the database schema for it has been tweaked to fully support UTF-8. However, this change applies to new installations of iRODS 4.3.0 only. Existing deployments will remain as-is.

The Metadata API provided by the Python iRODS Client (PRC) now supports the `ADMIN_KW` keyword. This change improves the developer experience around managing metadata by removing the need for complicated permission handling logic. Users relying on PAM for authentication will be happy to know that the PRC now escapes special characters in PAM passwords.

Work on the Indexing Capability has been merged. This includes improved handling of configuration integer/string values and support for `iput --metadata`.

To wrap up, we've been discussing how to present iRODS as an S3 endpoint. MinIO was the original choice for providing this functionality. However, MinIO has officially dropped support for its gateway interface. For that reason, we are now considering the idea of implementing the S3 API directly. If you're interested in that, please reach out to us.

iRODS 4.3.0 contains so many improvements and we can't wait to talk about them at UGM.

See you next month!
