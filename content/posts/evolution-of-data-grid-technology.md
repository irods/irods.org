The DICE Group has just published a history of the SRB and iRODS
technology.

It details the 20 years of research, thought, and development that is
the iRODS of today.

> Abstract
>
> The Data Intensive Computing Environments group has been developing
> data grid technology for twenty years. Two generations of technology
> were created, the Storage Resource Broker - SRB (1994-2006) and the
> integrated Rule Oriented Data System - iRODS (2004-2016). Both
> products represented pioneering technology in distributed data
> management and were widely applied by communities interested in not
> only publishing data, but also sharing and preserving data.
> Applications included national digital libraries, national data grids,
> national archives, and international collaborations. The success of
> the software was strongly driven by basic concepts that still
> represent the state-of-the-art for data management systems. These
> concepts include policy-based data management, virtualization,
> collection life cycle, and federation. The development, evolution, and
> application of these concepts in data grids, digital libraries and
> archives are reviewed in this paper.
