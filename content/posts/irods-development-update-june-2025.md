Hello reader,

The 17th Annual iRODS User Group Meeting was a success! As always it was a pleasure speaking with members of the community and listening to the interesting things they are working on.

For those who could not attend, you'll be happy to know that abstracts, slides, and video are now available from [https://irods.org/ugm2025](https://irods.org/ugm2025).

With that said, the iRODS team is taking a small break to recharge before the next development cycle. See our [newly updated roadmap](https://irods.org/roadmap/#2025) for details.

See you next month.
