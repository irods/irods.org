Status: published

RENCI is pleased to announce the fourth major open source release of
iRODS, managed and overseen by the [iRODS
Consortium](http://irods-consortium.org/).

iRODS 4.0.0 marks a reunification and merger of the community codebase
of iRODS and the Enterprise codebase of E-iRODS which diverged at iRODS
3.0 (released September 30, 2011).

All the code and current working issues are hosted at GitHub:
<https://github.com/irods/irods>

This release is another significant step towards a full plugin
architecture while remaining API compatible with existing iRODS 3.x
releases.  We are committed to keeping Federation with iRODS 3.x grids a
first class use case for the lifetime of iRODS 4.x.

4.0.0 includes all features and bugfixes through iRODS 3.3.1. This
release represents a full merger of the code through [community iRODS
r5681 (March 11,
2014)](https://github.com/irods/irods-legacy/commit/2a815f477a840b84f5c3891f6a00e1ca439cfc1a).

The MySQL database plugin is not packaged for CentOS 5, as the required
regular expression plugin (lib\_mysqludf\_preg) does not currently build
on CentOS 5 ([github
issue](https://github.com/mysqludf/lib_mysqludf_preg/issues/13)).

The Oracle database plugin is packaged only for Ubuntu at this time, but
as more test machines are configured, more Oracle packages will be made
available.
