Hello Everyone,

The [iRODS User Group Meeting](https://irods.org/ugm2023) was a success!

It was so wonderful being able to mingle with everyone and discuss various iRODS topics.

This year we had more than 20 presentations (including lightning talks) and roughly 100 attendees spanning 10 countries, half of those being in-person.

We heard many interesting things from people within the community and we're now going to take that information and push to improve iRODS for everyone.

I'm going to keep this update short, but know that great things are underway from the iRODS community.

We'll have more information to share next month. See you soon!
