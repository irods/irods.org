iRODS User Group Meeting 2015 is in the books, and it was a big success!

This was our largest User Group Meeting yet: We had ninety-one
registrants come to Chapel Hill, representing forty-eight different
organizations and eight countries.

We also had more than 40 attendees for the first official iRODS training
course, and we are using the terrific feedback that we've received to
plan additional training sessions in the future.

The presentation slides are now posted at
<https://irods.org/documentation/articles/irods-user-group-meeting-2015>
and <https://irods.org/documentation/articles> .

Over the coming weeks, we will review videos of selected talks and make
them available at the same site.

A huge thank you to all of the presenters and attendees, our Consortium
members, the staff of the Friday center, and the iRODS Consortium staff.

And a special thank you to our three sponsors, Seagate, DDN, and EMC for
helping us host this year's User Group Meeting and evening reception.
