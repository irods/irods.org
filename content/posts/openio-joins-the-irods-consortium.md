The [iRODS Consortium](https://irods.org), the foundation that leads development and support of the integrated
Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) data management software, welcomes OpenIO as its newest Consortium member.

[OpenIO](https://openio.io) is a software-defined, open source object storage solution designed for big data and
artificial intelligence applications. OpenIO scales easily while delivering consistent performance and can be
deployed on-premise, cloud-hosted or at the edge, and on any hardware mix that customers choose.

iRODS is free open source software for data discovery, workflow automation, secure collaboration, and data
virtualization used by research and business organizations around the globe. iRODS allows users to automate data
management by creating a unified namespace and a metadata catalog of all the data and users within the storage
environment.

"High-performance storage solutions like OpenIO derive a great deal of value from iRODS' ability to efficiently
organize data," said Jason Coposky, Executive Director, iRODS Consortium. "Due to their focus on open source, our
organizations' goals are well aligned. Given that, we are well positioned to closely integrate iRODS and OpenIO as a
competitive solution, which will benefit the broader open source community."

OpenIO plans to use iRODS to orchestrate the movement of data while taking advantage of all of the performance benefits
and features of the OpenIO storage solution. Given iRODS' strong track record managing academic research data, OpenIO
Co-Founder and CTO Jean-Fran√ßois Smigielski also sees the collaboration as an opportunity to enhance OpenIO's ability
to address the needs of academic researchers through an integration with iRODS.

"OpenIO is an open core solution and we are firm believers in open source technology," said Smigielski. "We decided to
become an iRODS Consortium member because iRODS has the same open source philosophy, and because of the strong link
that exists between storage tiers and orchestrators. We wish to work closely with iRODS so that we can take advantage
of their evolving features and technology, which will enable OpenIO to propose new and innovative features as early as
possible."

The iRODS Consortium guides development and support of iRODS, along with providing production-ready iRODS distribution
and iRODS professional integration services, training, and support. The consortium is administered by founding member
[RENCI](https://renci.org), a research institute for applications of cyberinfrastructure located at the [University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://unc.edu).

In addition to OpenIO, current members of the iRODS Consortium include Agriculture Victoria, Bayer, Cloudian,
University of Colorado, Boulder, DataDirect Networks, Maastricht University, MSC, the U.S. National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences, NetApp, Quantum, RENCI, SURF, the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing, SUSE,
Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), University College London, University of Groningen, Utrecht University, the
Wellcome Sanger Institute, and Western Digital.
