RENCI is attending the [2013 iRODS User Group Meeting in Garching,
Germany]({filename}/pages/ugm2013.html)
this week.

The meeting is being hosted by the [Max Planck Institute of Plasma
Physics (IPP)](http://www.ipp.mpg.de/ippcms/eng/index.html).

As part of the move to a plugin-based architecture, existing
functionality in iRODS is being pulled into components which are written
to a common interface. This architecture allows for a more flexible
development model, more comprehensive testing, dynamic availability, and
the composability of iRODS resources.

Our first presentation at the meeting is about Composable Resources
which are scheduled to be included in our upcoming 3.0b3 release.

> RENCI has developed composable resources for Enterprise iRODS
> (E-iRODS) which allow for shareable, flexible definitions of storage
> resources. Using a well-defined tree metaphor to describe composite
> resources provides insight into existing resources as well as a
> powerful tool for envisioning new resource configurations. Defined
> resources can be shared and iterated within the community easily as
> they are plugins, external from the E-iRODS core.
