I recently had the opportunity to talk about iRODS in London and
Shenzhen. The timing worked out juuust right, so I was able to make both
meetings while flying east the whole time.

The trip started out with a joint iRODS-DDN User Group Meeting at
University College London. We discussed iRODS integration with DDN
hardware, the [Consortium vision for grid configuration
management]({static}/uploads/2014/09/iRODS-4.0-and-Beyond-UK-September-2014.pdf "iRODS DDN UK User Group Meeting Slides"),
and use cases from University College London, the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute, University of Florida, the iPlant Collaborative, and Public
Health England. Presentations from the event are available
[here]({static}/uploads/2014/09/iRODS-4.0-and-Beyond-UK-September-2014.pdf "iRODS DDN UK User Group Meeting Slides").

From London, I traveled to Shenzhen for the International Conference on
Genomics. It was fascinating to listen to talks on topics ranging from
biobanking to microbiota of the digestive tract to the publication of
genomics data sets. I presented on our recent initiative to create a
reference implementation for next generation sequencing. (Slides

I'm seeking input from iRODS users and life sciences researchers! Please
contact me.

ICG-9 was followed by a day of touring BGI and the China National
GeneBank, which is set to bring 500 PB of genomics data storage online
over the next couple years. Impressive is an understatement.

And then, a day later, I was back home from a very informative, very
productive trip.
