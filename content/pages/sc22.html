            <h3>Protocol Plumbing:<br/>Presenting iRODS as WebDAV, FUSE, REST, NFS, SFTP, K8s CSI, and S3</h3><br>

            <p>
            The open source iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System) data management platform presents a
            virtual filesystem, metadata catalog, and policy engine designed to give organizations maximum
            control and flexibility over their data management practices and enforcement.  Since iRODS defines
            its own RPC API and protocol, interoperability with other software has always lagged new server
            features and functionality.  In the last few years, the iRODS Community has been working on multiple
            ways to present the iRODS protocol more conveniently to other software.
            </p>

            <p>
            This talk covers the efforts to present iRODS as WebDAV, FUSE, REST, NFS, SFTP, K8s CSI, and S3.
            </p>

            <p>
            The iRODS Consortium was started as an open-source software development organization in 2013 by
            members of the research and storage communities. The technology has roots from an earlier project
            started in 1995. The Consortium was launched as a response to a major scale increase in management
            and storage needs driven by the advent of "big data". The member community is now comprised of over
            30 members and spans the globe from the Australia to Japan and much of the EU.
