            All iRODS Consortium events are dedicated to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin, operating system or text editor of choice. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
            <br/><br/>
            If a participant, including but not limited to attendees, speakers, sponsors, exhibitors, staff, and volunteers, engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling the offender from the conference with no refund.
            <br/><br/>
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by iRODS staff t-shirts or special badges.
            <br/><br/>
            The iRODS Consortium intends for these policies to meet the needs of our constituents to have a positive event experience, and we welcome comments and suggestions from the community. Please contact iRODS Consortium staff onsite or by email/phone if you would like to provide feedback.
