                The iRODS Partner Program is designed to connect organizations who need iRODS help with organizations who know iRODS.

                While the iRODS Consortium also provides iRODS-specific services and support, iRODS Partners can bring additional capabilities to bear, for example: scientific domain expertise, deep integration with a particular technology solution, and 24/7 global support.
