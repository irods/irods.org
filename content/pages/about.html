                    <br />
                    Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ) brings together three institutions whose purpose is to bring knowledge and culture to the entire province of Québec.
                    The National Library collects, processes and preserves all materials published in Québec and ensures that as many people as possible can access the heritage collections it has acquired.
                    The National Archives house public and private archives and provide access to them online and through 10 archives centres located throughout Québec. They also provide a framework to help public organizations manage their materials.
                    The Grande Bibliothèque is a cultural meeting place in the heart of the city that provides free access to the largest collection of French books and materials in America. Québec's public library also has a wide variety of digital resources.
                    <br/><br/>
                    BAnQ plays an active role in promoting Québec culture online.
