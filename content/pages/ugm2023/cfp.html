                In the abstract, presenters should summarize how they have used or extended iRODS to impact individuals, society, science, or systems and technology.
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Impact on Individuals</b> – Advancements in data management, information retrieval, human-computer interaction, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Impact on Society</b> – Archival preservation, policy development, intellectual property, information access, resource management, emergency preparedness, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Impact on Science</b> – Collaboration, information architecture, knowledge management, competitive intelligence, digital curation, records and archives management, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Impact on Systems &amp; Technology</b> – User interface, plugin development, benchmarking, process automation, workflows, rules, policy, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Abstracts will be judged on such criteria as quality of content, significance and impact, method, design, innovation, originality, and fit with the meeting theme.
                <br><br>
                Authors of accepted talks and demonstrations will be invited to present at the User Group Meeting.
