            We will be holding a FREE mini-workshop at SC24 in Atlanta, Georgia:<br><br>
            <h3>iRODS Updates and Troubleshooting</h3><br>

            <p>
            The open source iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System) data management platform presents a
            virtual filesystem, metadata catalog, and policy engine designed to give organizations maximum
            control and flexibility over their data management practices and enforcement.
            </p>

            <p>
            This workshop will share a year's worth of updates including work done in the server, a new PAM 
            Interactive Authentication Plugin, HTTP and OpenID Connect functionality, the S3 API, and 3 new client
            libraries written by our summer interns.  We'll also talk about the future of iRODS 5.0 and what it
            may mean for integrations to come.
            </p>

            <p>
            In addition, join us for troubleshooting time with the experts.  Bring us your tricky questions and
            weird scenarios.  Come learn from others.
            </p>

            <p>
            The iRODS Consortium was started as an open source software development organization in 2013 by
            members of the research and storage communities.  The technology has roots from an earlier project
            started in 1995.  The Consortium was launched as a response to a major scale increase in management
            and storage needs driven by the advent of "big data".  The member community is now comprised of over
            25 members and spans the globe from Australia to Japan and much of the EU.
