                The iRODS Consortium is pleased to present the annual iRODS UGM Best Student Technology Award.
                <br/><br/>
                The <a href="{filename}/pages/history.html">DICE team (including Reagan Moore, Arcot Rajasekar, and Hao Xu)</a>,
                along with the iRODS Consortium, has funded this $200 award into the future and to encourage submissions of
                ongoing iRODS-related work from students around the world.  Examples may include, but are not limited to,
                a new iRODS client or library, an integration with existing infrastructure, or a particular piece of policy.
                <br/><br/>
                To be eligible, the student (from undergraduate to doctoral) must be a named author on the submission and present their work at the User Group Meeting.
                <br/><br/>
                Submissions will be judged based on the technology, not the presentation.
                The award will be announced by the beginning of the conference.
                <br/><br/>
                Employees of the iRODS Consortium are ineligible.
