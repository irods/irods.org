                We are seeking presentations on iRODS-related activities. Each presentation will be delivered in one of the following formats:
                <br><br>
                Descriptive talk: 20-minute explanation of novel iRODS application or development, with Q&amp;A<br>
                Demonstration: 40-minute explanation plus a live technology exhibition, with Q&amp;A
                <br><br>
                Individuals who wish to present at the UGM must submit an abstract for evaluation by the meeting’s program committee.

                In the abstract, presenters should summarize how they have used or extended iRODS to impact individuals, society, science, or systems and technology.
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Impact on Individuals</b> – Advancements in data management; information retrieval; human-computer interaction; etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Impact on Society</b> – Archival preservation; policy development; intellectual property; information access; resource management; emergency preparedness; etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Impact on Science</b> – Collaboration; information architecture; knowledge management; competitive intelligence; digital curation; records and archives management; etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Impact on Systems &amp; Technology</b> – User interface; plugin development; benchmarking; microservices; rules; policies; etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Abstracts will be judged on such criteria as quality of content, significance and impact, method, design, innovation, originality, and fit with the meeting theme.
                <br><br>
                Authors of accepted talks and demonstrations will be invited to present at the User Group Meeting.
                <br><br>
                Presenters are also invited to submit papers for inclusion in the User Group Meeting Proceedings. A full paper (6-8 pages) or short paper (3-4 pages) must be received by June 1, 2017 to be considered for publication.
                <br><br>
                You do not need to be a member of the iRODS Consortium to present at the User Group Meeting.
