                    Zoey graduated from Virginia Tech in 2012 with a Bachelor’s degree, double-majoring in Computer Science and Philosophy. After a short stint at IBM, she joined the iRODS team in late 2013. She cares deeply about both science and open source, so an open source project supporting science turned out to be the perfect fit. Like most devs, she enjoys refactoring, debugging, and long strings of commits on a feature branch. Her main responsibilities on iRODS are resolving issues uncovered by testing, keeping iRODS up-to-date with the technologies we use, and developing and designing new features.
