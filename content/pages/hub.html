                Davrods provides access to iRODS servers using the WebDAV protocol. It is a bridge between the WebDAV protocol and the iRODS API, implemented as an Apache HTTPD module. Supports WebDAV Class2, Native and PAM authentication, optional SSL encryption, and it compatible with iRODS server versions 4+ and 3.3.1.

                <div><i>Posted February 4, 2016</i></div><br/>
                John Jacquay and the Cyberinfrastructure group at the University of Florida’s Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) have developed an iRODS client library written in Go called “GoRods”. It wraps the iRODS C API, and provides easy to use, high level abstractions for interacting with iRODS resources. Applications implementing the GoRODS library compile to native machine code, enabling the development of high performance and scalable iRODS clients. No scripting language interpreter required.<br/>

                <div><i>Posted October 5, 2015</i></div><br/>
                Ilari Korhonen has developed a graphical user interface for iRODS that runs natively on Mac OS X and Linux. The software is written in C++ on top of the Qt framework and the native iRODS Client API and thus runs with full native performance on the supported platforms while remaining portable. Also, because of the native iRODS interface, the application supports both SSL and TCP transport modes and all of the iRODS authentication plugins (e.g. Kerberos).<br/>

                A team at Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB) has implemented a Long Term Data Preservation system using Islandora to provide a front end, access control, and preservation policy implementation; iRODS for metadata and storage resource management; and Archivematica for data ingest. This system was presented at Open Repositories 2015 (pdf).<br/>

                <div><i>Posted June 8, 2015</i></div><br/>
                This rule and microservice were used in the training session at the 2015 iRODS User Group Meeting to demonstrate workflow automation using the iRODS Rule Engine. The microservice uses Imagemagick to extract metadata from image files. An example rule is provided, which uses the acPostProcForPut PEP to identify incoming images, extract the metadata, and associate the metadata with the image in the iCAT.
