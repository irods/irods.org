                TRiRODS is a local meetup for iRODS users and developers in the RDU area.
                TRiRODS works to build a strong sense of community, to offer a space for collaboration and sharing of individual implementations of iRODS, and to further the work on a hardened version of the code.

                    This talk covers the newly published synchronization policy example from the iRODS Consortium. The demo will use the Python Rule Engine Plugin and the Automated Ingest Framework to monitor a data source for new or changed files and then keeps those changes up-to-date in the iRODS Vault and catalog. With only three configuration variables, this example synchronization policy can easily handle the ingest and sync requirements for most organizations.

                    DNA sequencing technology has evolved rapidly and resulted in data storage challenges for research organizations. Syngenta’s Next Generation Sequencing platform has been successful at getting data to researchers and analysts. However, there are opportunities to improve the users’ access to the data and the organization’s ability to manage and track data. Towards leveraging these opportunities, Syngenta has implemented a pilot of iRODS that integrates with their current processes and ways of working.

                    <i>By Rick Skarbez, iRODS Consortium</i><br>

                    <br><br>
                    Metadata templates represent a significant addition of functionality to iRODS’s handling of metadata. In base iRODS, metadata is stored in the catalog as unadorned attribute-value-unit (AVU) triples of strings. This is flexible for many use cases, but does not afford the grid administrators much control of any stored metadata. By extending iRODS metadata, specifically by associating the AVU triples stored in the catalog with metadata templates which can provide additional information about these metadata elements (or meta-metadata), we can now support a variety of interesting functions.
                    <br><br>
                    This talk explains the motivation behind metadata templates, presents a proof of concept implementation of metadata templates, and demonstrates the use of this implementation via their REST API, currently in development.

                    Groups maintaining data repositories at the petabyte-scale are discovering that cataloguing associated metadata is necessary to properly access, recall and analyze data.  To be successful they depend on researchers and data curators to design and provide the user defined metadata to be successful. Metalnx was developed to aid researchers with metadata management under iRODS (the Integrated Rule Oriented Data System) and is now an open source project (<a href="https://metalnx.github.io/" >metalnx.github.io</a> or <a href="http://www.github.com/metalnx">www.github.com/metalnx</a>)

                    This talk explains the motivation for this work, demonstrates the operational behavior of Metalnx, provides a preview of our work in data validation, and looks at a model for applying adaptive, hierarchical metadata to research curation.
