                    The iRODS Consortium has been conducting its Authentication Working Group for several years. The product of the working group has been a new client-driven authentication framework and the pam_interactive authentication plugin. This plugin allows iRODS clients to enable complex flows with PAM for authentication with iRODS. This talk will demonstrate an OIDC flow implemented by SURF using the new pam_interactive plugin and give some updates on the state of the project.

                    An iRODS Zone can describe its own configuration with a ZoneReport. The schema that defines the ZoneReport is now a bit out of date as the server itself has changed for 4.3.0. Nishant refactored the zone_bundle.json schema and updated the machinery that produces and depends on this format. Issues addressed include the naming of server roles, duplicate plugins, hierarchy information for resources, and self-aware versioning.

                    NFSRODS is a client to iRODS that presents iRODS as the NFSv4.1 protocol. We have found that restarting the server disrupts existing clients because the inodes (file handles) do not remain consistent across restarts.  This has now been fixed and provides persistent identifiers.

                    The Automated Ingest tool is a Python application designed to keep the iRODS catalog up to date with changes in an existing filesystem or S3 bucket. The S3 scanner has implemented the REGISTER_SYNC operation for registering data in-place, but does not yet know how to make a copy of the scanned data into iRODS. This work implements PUT_SYNC to fill out the requested feature.

                    The iRODS General Query (GenQuery) interface exists to provide an SQL-like syntax for searching the iRODS namespace.  It implements the SELECT and WHERE clauses but does not expose the FROM clause to the user so that the iRODS permission model can be enforced.  The joins are determined by the server based on the requested tokens (or columns).  This new flex and bison implementation provides a richer SQL-like syntax which allows for more powerful searches to be executed.  This talk will include the goals of the updated interface and syntax, its current implementation, and a demonstration.

                    An iRODS server uses a process model which spawns independent agents to service incoming requests. While performant and relatively safe, the agents do not currently interact and will hold stale information when another part of the system changes. This talk covers the work done to automatically reload configuration changes without requiring a server restart.

                    <br><br>
                    The iRODS Consortium received an issue stating that the AMQP Audit Rule Engine Plugin generated invalid JSON. An investigation revealed that the issue does not originate from the Plugin itself, but rather from incompatibility between two versions of AMQP used in the iRODS demo ELK stack. We discuss the nature of that problem as well as steps forward.
                    <br><br>
                    The iRODS REST API did not expose entity rename, delete, repl, or trim functionality, nor did it allow add, remove, or modify of metadata AVUs. I investigated the architecture of the iRODS REST API and created endpoints for these actions.

                    This talk introduces a new iRODS backend for MinIO, a scalable, secure, S3-compatible object storage for cloud users. The iRODS backend to MinIO allows users to configure their iRODS login to access their restricted data or anonymous access to public/shared data with an iRODS Ticket. By integrating with MinIO, iRODS users can leverage the user-friendly mode of data access provided by the MinIO user interface and the MinIO object store REST API.

                    This talk introduces two features that will be included in iRODS 4.3.  First, a new facility within the iRODS server to manage background tasks, including (re)starting the Rule Execution (Delay) Server.  Second, the Delay Server's new capability to send delayed rules to other servers in the iRODS Zone.  These two features provide greater availability and scalability to the iRODS Delay Server mechanism.

                    <br><br>
                    Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems deployed up to now have suffered
                    from well-known and well-publicized design defects in both security and scalability. This
                    work introduces a simplistic SCADA model with InfiniBand for network security and iRODS as
                    a data manipulation subsystem to provide credibility should any intrusions occur.

                    The <a href="https://github.com/irods/python-irodsclient">Python iRODS Client (PRC)</a> is learning some new tricks.  First, the iRODS 4.2.8 server provides an API endpoint for atomic updates of multiple metadata operations.
Second, an experimental feature in the upcoming iRODS 4.2.9 server provides a facility for parallel file transfer, using multiple connections over port 1247.
This presentation will cover both of these new developments as well as how to use them via Python.

                    The <a href="https://github.com/cyverse/irods-csi-driver">iRODS Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver</a> implements the CSI Specification to provide iRODS access to Kubernetes. This allows iRODS to be used as a shared and permanent storage for Kubernetes apps. The iRODS CSI Driver mounts iRODS collections on directory hierarchies in Kubernetes apps by using iRODS clients (iRODS FUSE, NFS client and Davfs2) automatically. Therefore, Kubernetes apps can access data in iRODS without manual data staging or iRODS clients manipulation. This talk covers i) whatâ€™s CSI Driver, ii) how the iRODS CSI Driver works, iii) how to use the driver (demo), iv) tips for driver configuration and v) future development plan.

                    The 7th generation of the iRODS test infrastructure uses Jenkins, Docker, and Python to give us confidence in the entire system. Once complete, it will allow Consortium members (and anyone else) to test any changes they would propose to iRODS core and plugins before creating a pull request. With this infrastructure, iRODS is welcoming a more collaborative development process.

                    <br><br>
                    Historically a single static policy enforcement point, such as acPostProcForPut, was the sole location for all policy implementation.  With the addition of a continuation code to the rule engine plugin framework, we may now configure multiple policies to be invoked for any given policy enforcement point.  This subsequently allows for a separation of concerns and clean policy implementation. The policy developers now have the ability to separate the "when" (the policy enforcement points) from the "what" (the policy itself).   How the policy is then invoked becomes a matter of configuration rather than implementation.
                    <br><br>
                    Given this new approach, multiple policies can now be configured together, or composed, without the need to touch the code. For example, the Storage Tiering capability is effectively a collection of several basic policies: Replication, Verification, Retention, and the Violating Object Discovery. All of these policies are configured via metadata annotating root resources, and taken as a whole provide a flexible system for automated data movement.

                    The University of Colorado Boulder Research Computing allocates storage space to end-user projects, and enforces these allocations with size and file limits within the namespace. A recent deployment of StrongBox left us without this capability for our LTFS archive environment; so we have deployed these quotas using the iRODS policy engine.
                    <br><br>
                    The new C++ "logical quotas" rule engine plugin was implemented by the iRODS Consortium, in collaboration with CU Boulder, and is driven by metadata stored on iRODS Collections.

                    NFSRODS is an iRODS Client that presents the iRODS virtual file system as NFSv4.1. This allows iRODS to be surfaced into any existing infrastructure with just a mount command, while still preserving the server-side policies enforced by the iRODS API.

                    The demo explains the security model assumptions and shows events from regular file system activity appearing in an iRODS audit dashboard.

                    Over the last year, iRODS has released two packaged capabilities that many users are interested in configuring together. This talk will demonstrate using the Automated Ingest Framework and wiring it directly into the Storage Tiering Framework. This approach duplicates most of the functionality of an enterprise hierarchical file system.

                    This talk covers the newly published synchronization policy example from the iRODS Consortium. The demo will use the Python Rule Engine Plugin and the Automated Ingest Framework to monitor a data source for new or changed files and then keeps those changes up-to-date in the iRODS Vault and catalog. With only three configuration variables, this example synchronization policy can easily handle the ingest and sync requirements for most organizations.

                    DNA sequencing technology has evolved rapidly and resulted in data storage challenges for research organizations. Syngentaâ€™s Next Generation Sequencing platform has been successful at getting data to researchers and analysts. However, there are opportunities to improve the usersâ€™ access to the data and the organizationâ€™s ability to manage and track data. Towards leveraging these opportunities, Syngenta has implemented a pilot of iRODS that integrates with their current processes and ways of working.

                    Metadata templates represent a significant addition of functionality to iRODSâ€™s handling of metadata. In base iRODS, metadata is stored in the catalog as unadorned attribute-value-unit (AVU) triples of strings. This is flexible for many use cases, but does not afford the grid administrators much control of any stored metadata. By extending iRODS metadata, specifically by associating the AVU triples stored in the catalog with metadata templates which can provide additional information about these metadata elements (or meta-metadata), we can now support a variety of interesting functions.
                    <br><br>
                    This talk explains the motivation behind metadata templates, presents a proof of concept implementation of metadata templates, and demonstrates the use of this implementation via their REST API, currently in development.

                    Groups maintaining data repositories at the petabyte-scale are discovering that cataloguing associated metadata is necessary to properly access, recall and analyze data.  To be successful they depend on researchers and data curators to design and provide the user defined metadata to be successful. Metalnx was developed to aid researchers with metadata management under iRODS (the Integrated Rule Oriented Data System) and is now an open source project (<a href="https://metalnx.github.io/" >metalnx.github.io</a> or <a href="http://www.github.com/metalnx">www.github.com/metalnx</a>)
                    <br><br>
                    This talk explains the motivation for this work, demonstrates the operational behavior of Metalnx, provides a preview of our work in data validation, and looks at a model for applying adaptive, hierarchical metadata to research curation.

                    Terrell and Justin showed how the audit plugin works within the iRODS Rule Engine Framework. The AMQP messages generated by every operation in iRODS can be queued, pulled by Logstash into Elasticsearch, and then displayed by Kibana as realtime dashboards of live activity within an iRODS Zone.
