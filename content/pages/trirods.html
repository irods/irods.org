                TRiRODS is a local meetup for iRODS users and developers in the RDU area.
                TRiRODS works to build a strong sense of community, to offer a space for collaboration and sharing of individual implementations of iRODS, and to further the work on a hardened version of the code.

                    We will discuss current status of client libraries and interfaces, with a discussion about next steps for Metalnx, REST, and a few other APIs. There will be some time for open discussion of client needs and opportunities, and perhaps an update of changes to iRODS APIs and services that could help client development.

                    NFSRODS is an iRODS Client that presents the iRODS virtual file system as NFSv4.1. This allows iRODS to be surfaced into any existing infrastructure with just a mount command, while still preserving the server-side policies enforced by the iRODS API.

                    The demo explains the security model assumptions and shows events from regular file system activity appearing in an iRODS audit dashboard.

                    Over the last year, iRODS has released two packaged capabilities that many users are interested in configuring together. This talk will demonstrate using the Automated Ingest Framework and wiring it directly into the Storage Tiering Framework. This approach duplicates most of the functionality of an enterprise hierarchical file system.

                    This talk covers the newly published synchronization policy example from the iRODS Consortium. The demo will use the Python Rule Engine Plugin and the Automated Ingest Framework to monitor a data source for new or changed files and then keeps those changes up-to-date in the iRODS Vault and catalog. With only three configuration variables, this example synchronization policy can easily handle the ingest and sync requirements for most organizations.

                    DNA sequencing technology has evolved rapidly and resulted in data storage challenges for research organizations. Syngentaâ€™s Next Generation Sequencing platform has been successful at getting data to researchers and analysts. However, there are opportunities to improve the usersâ€™ access to the data and the organizationâ€™s ability to manage and track data. Towards leveraging these opportunities, Syngenta has implemented a pilot of iRODS that integrates with their current processes and ways of working.

                    Metadata templates represent a significant addition of functionality to iRODSâ€™s handling of metadata. In base iRODS, metadata is stored in the catalog as unadorned attribute-value-unit (AVU) triples of strings. This is flexible for many use cases, but does not afford the grid administrators much control of any stored metadata. By extending iRODS metadata, specifically by associating the AVU triples stored in the catalog with metadata templates which can provide additional information about these metadata elements (or meta-metadata), we can now support a variety of interesting functions.
                    <br><br>
                    This talk explains the motivation behind metadata templates, presents a proof of concept implementation of metadata templates, and demonstrates the use of this implementation via their REST API, currently in development.

                    Groups maintaining data repositories at the petabyte-scale are discovering that cataloguing associated metadata is necessary to properly access, recall and analyze data.  To be successful they depend on researchers and data curators to design and provide the user defined metadata to be successful. Metalnx was developed to aid researchers with metadata management under iRODS (the Integrated Rule Oriented Data System) and is now an open source project (<a href="https://metalnx.github.io/" >metalnx.github.io</a> or <a href="http://www.github.com/metalnx">www.github.com/metalnx</a>)
                    <br><br>
                    This talk explains the motivation for this work, demonstrates the operational behavior of Metalnx, provides a preview of our work in data validation, and looks at a model for applying adaptive, hierarchical metadata to research curation.

                    John presented an overview of his library, performance numbers, and a demo of a lightweight GO REST web client built on top of GoRODS. As a surprise, he released version 1.0 near the end of his presentation, pushing live to GitHub.

                    Terrell and Justin showed how the audit plugin works within the iRODS Rule Engine Framework. The AMQP messages generated by every operation in iRODS can be queued, pulled by Logstash into Elasticsearch, and then displayed by Kibana as realtime dashboards of live activity within an iRODS Zone.
