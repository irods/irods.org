            <h3>iRODS Research Community Requirements Drive Expanded Scale Data Management Features</h3><br>

            <p>
            Several years ago, the entire process of data management and collaboration could only be
            performed with the use of proprietary software products that were expensive to license. To
            maintain a collection, data sites required a file system, hierarchical storage management
            system, and some means of sharing the data over several geographically diverse sites using
            purchased software, often from a single vendor to ensure compatibility. Data site managers
            were placed in a difficult position facing quickly growing data capacity and transmission
            demands with limited budgets. Constraints from funding agencies and governments became very
            difficult, if not impossible, to manage and audit.
            </p>

            <p>
            The iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System) Consortium was started as an open-source
            software development organization in 2013 by members of the research and storage communities.
            The technology has roots from an earlier project started in 1995. The Consortium was launched
            as a response to a major scale increase in management and storage needs driven by the advent
            of "big data". The member community is now comprised of over 30 members and spans the globe
            from the Australia to Japan and much of the EU. Recent innovations as a result of community
            requirements will be discussed including graphical interfaces and methods to ensure data
            persistence and replication management. In addition, partnerships will be discussed with
            Globus and others to enable large scale collaboration. Today, worldwide, FAIR discovery and
            directed dissemination of HPC results are being accomplished in sites controlling tens of
            petabytes of data with this open-source technology.
