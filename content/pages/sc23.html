            <h3>iRODS 4.3.1, HTTP, OIDC, and S3</h3><br>

            <p>
            The open source iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System) data management platform presents a
            virtual filesystem, metadata catalog, and policy engine designed to give organizations maximum
            control and flexibility over their data management practices and enforcement.  As iRODS has always
            defined its own protocol and RPC API, interoperability with other protocols has been left to
            application developers and administrators.
            </p>

            <p>
            This year's releases of iRODS 4.3.1 as well as standalone APIs exposing iRODS via HTTP and S3 help
            new users use their existing, familiar tools to integrate with an iRODS Zone.
            </p>

            <p>
            This set of talks will cover these efforts and give a glimpse of where we're headed next.
            </p>

            <p>
            The iRODS Consortium was started as an open-source software development organization in 2013 by
            members of the research and storage communities. The technology has roots from an earlier project
            started in 1995. The Consortium was launched as a response to a major scale increase in management
            and storage needs driven by the advent of "big data". The member community is now comprised of over
            30 members and spans the globe from Australia to Japan and much of the EU.
