                RENCI complies with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations concerning the exporting of technology and software. The <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/export-administration-regulations-ear">Export Administration Regulations (EAR)</a> are issued by the <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/">United States Department of Commerce</a>, <a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/">Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)</a> under laws relating to the control of certain exports, re-exports and activities.

                The mission of BIS is to advance U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic objectives by ensuring an effective export control and treaty compliance system. The export control provisions of the EAR are intended to serve the national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation, and short supply interests of the United States. The U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and BIS maintain embargoes and other sanctions against certain foreign governments, individuals and entities. The EAR prohibits knowingly exporting or re-exporting any item subject to the EAR to an end-user or for end-uses that are prohibited by part 744 of the EAR. Unless an authorization is provided by the U.S. government, exports and re-exports to countries under embargoes or sanctions are prohibited. For specific country information please see the <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Foreign-Assets-Control.aspx">OFAC</a> website.
